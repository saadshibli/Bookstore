This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## **Backend Development: Phase 1 Kickoff**

The goal for this initial phase is to build the foundational services and the first set of critical API endpoints.

### **1. Initial Setup (Anurag & Saad)**

* **Task:** Create the project's folder structure (`/lib`, `/models`, etc.) and the `develop` branch in your Git repository.
    * **Lead:** **Saad**
* **Task:** Set up the initial AWS infrastructure: a PostgreSQL database on **RDS**, an **S3** bucket for storage, and an initial **Elastic Beanstalk** environment for the backend application.
    * **Lead:** **Anurag**

### **2. Implement Core Database Models (Anurag, Saad, Himanshu)**

* **Task:** Based on the agreed-upon data shapes, create the initial code files for the core Mongoose/Prisma schemas.
    * `src/models/user.model.ts`
    * `src/models/product.model.ts`
    * `src/models/order.model.ts`
* **Lead:** **Anurag** will own the final schema implementation, with input from **Saad** and **Himanshu**.

### **3. Develop Initial API Endpoints (Parallel Work)**

This is where the team will work on different parts of the API simultaneously. Everyone should create their own feature branches from `develop` (e.g., `feature/auth-api`).

* **Task: Build the Authentication API (Priority #1)**
    * **Description:** Implement the complete user login and registration flow. Create the API endpoints to handle Firebase token verification and user creation in the database.
    * **Endpoints:**
        * `POST /api/auth/login` (Verifies Firebase token, finds or creates a user, returns a session token)
        * `GET /api/users/me` (A protected route to fetch the currently logged-in user's profile)
    * **Lead:** **Anurag**

* **Task: Build the Admin Product Management API**
    * **Description:** Create the secure, admin-only endpoints for managing products. This is the core of your responsibilities.
    * **Endpoints:**
        * `POST /api/admin/products` (Create a new product)
        * `PUT /api/admin/products/:id` (Update an existing product)
        * `DELETE /api/admin/products/:id` (Delete a product)
        * `GET /api/admin/products` (Get a list of all products for the admin view)
    * **Lead:** **Saad**

* **Task: Build the Public Product Catalog API**
    * **Description:** Create the public-facing endpoints that will be used to display products to all users on the website.
    * **Endpoints:**
        * `GET /api/products` (Fetch a list of products, including logic for filtering, sorting, and pagination to support infinite scroll)
        * `GET /api/products/:slug` (Fetch the details for a single product by its slug/ID)
    * **Lead:** **Himanshu**

### **4. API Testing and Documentation**

* **Task:** As you build your endpoints, use a tool like **Postman** or **Insomnia** to test them thoroughly.
* **Task:** Create a simple `API_DOCS.md` file in the project root. As you complete an endpoint, add a note about its URL, the expected request body, and what a successful response looks like. This will be critical for the frontend team.

### **Parallel Task: UI/UX Design**

* While the backend team works on the above, **Binita** will be focused on completing the high-fidelity Figma designs for all the core user flows.


---
## **Step 1:**

* For Saad & Himanshu: Your first action is to sync up with Anurag to finalize the User, Product, and Order models. Once that's clear, you can create your respective feature branches from develop and begin building your initial API endpoints.

For Anurag: Your top priority is the foundational work. Get the initial AWS services running and then tackle the feature/auth-api. The team's progress will build upon this core service.

For Binita: Your focus remains on completing the high-fidelity Figma designs, which will serve as the blueprint for the entire frontend.
